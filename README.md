# Liberum

Liberum is a decentralized domain and hosting infrastructure that leverages **blockchain technology** to provide a censorship-resistant, fully user-controlled internet experience. By using **Blockspaces** (ERC-721 tokens representing domain names) and **on-chain storage** for HTML content, Liberum removes the need for centralized DNS providers and traditional cloud hosting services.

---

## Overview

- **Decentralized Domains:** Users mint **Blockspaces**, which serve as unique, blockchain-registered domain names. Each Blockspace is an ERC-721 NFT that can be traded, transferred, or renewed.
- **On-Chain Content:** HTML files and other assets are stored directly in a smart contract. With **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE** functions, users can update their content without centralized intermediaries.
- **Browser Extension:** A custom extension for Chrome (and potentially other browsers) that resolves `.lib` domains via smart contracts instead of DNS. When someone types a `.lib` address, the extension fetches and renders the site directly from the blockchain.
- **Censorship Resistance:** Because domains and content are on-chain, there is no single point of failure and no centralized entity that can remove or block access.

## Key Features

1. **Blockspaces (Domains)**

   - **ERC-721 NFTs:** Each Blockspace is minted as an ERC-721 token, making it easily transferrable and tradeable.
   - **Time-Limited Mint:** Domains can be minted for a defined period (e.g., one or two years). After expiration, the owner must renew, akin to a traditional domain model.
   - **Decentralized Discovery:** Newly minted domains appear in the “Newest” section, and the most popular domains (based on anonymous visit data) show up in “Trending.”

2. **On-Chain Content Management**

   - **Smart Contract Storage:** User HTML content is stored directly on the blockchain, secured by cryptographic consensus.
   - **CRUD Operations:** A specialized smart contract supports **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE**, giving users total control over their site’s data and layout.
   - **Scalable with Conduit G2:** By leveraging Conduit G2’s high throughput and low fees, Liberum makes storing larger files more cost-effective compared to conventional on-chain solutions.

3. **Browser Extension**

   - **Seamless .lib Resolution:** Automatically detects `.lib` domains in the address bar, fetches content from the blockchain, and renders it in the browser.
   - **Anonymous Visit Tracking:** With user consent, the extension anonymously tracks visits to `.lib` domains, enabling “Top Sites” and “Trending” rankings on Liberum’s main screen.
   - **User-Centric:** Eliminates the need for centralized DNS or hosting services, giving complete ownership and control to the user.

4. **DAO & Multisig Support**

   - **Collaborative Ownership:** Domains and content can be managed not only by individuals but also by DAOs or multisig wallets for collective decision-making.
   - **Secure Governance:** DAOs can mint, transfer, or renew Blockspaces, and update content, ensuring transparent, democratic control.

5. **Ranking & Discovery**
   - **Trending Domains:** Based on the extension’s aggregated (anonymous) visit data, highly visited `.lib` sites are displayed in a leaderboard.
   - **Newest Domains:** Freshly minted Blockspaces are automatically listed in the main interface, fostering continuous community discovery.

## Demo & Screenshots

We have prepared a **pitch deck** (included in this repository) illustrating how Liberum works step by step:

1. **Minting a Blockspace:** Users pick a unique `.lib` name, select a registration period, and mint the ERC-721 token representing their domain.
2. **Linking Content:** Upload HTML (or other files) to the Liberum smart contract, creating a fully on-chain website.
3. **Visiting a .lib Site:** With the Liberum extension, simply type your `.lib` address in the browser, and Liberum will fetch and display your on-chain site.
4. **Discovery & Trends:** Check out the “Newest” or “Trending” lists to find interesting decentralized websites from the Liberum community.
